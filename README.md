# Personal-Website
**Built:** August 2022 â€“ Present

Welcome to my personal website! This is a simple front-end browser application built on React, providing a visual introduction on who I am, what I do, and where I can be found. The aspect of which I am perhaps the most proud would have to be the graphic designs... all done by yours truly in Illustrator. Lots of trial and error :D

The live website has been deployed [here](https://www.simonou.com) using Firebase. As with any small-scale React app, use `npm run build` and `npm start` to develop, build, and test changes!
